## Heists? #
Instead of doing a normal bank robbery minigame as always, heists can be more then just robbing a bank. Heist is just a general term for many other robberies. This command features themes, which users can easily create new themes, like robbing shops to other places. Check out the community themes and the how to create a theme wiki to learn more.
